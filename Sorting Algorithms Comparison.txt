Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort differ in their time and space complexities.  

Insertion Sort has a best-case time complexity of O(n) when the array is nearly sorted, but its average and worst-case complexities are O(n²). 
It is in-place (O(1) space) and stable, making it useful for small or nearly sorted datasets.  

Bubble Sort also has a best-case complexity of O(n) when the array is already sorted but is inefficient for larger datasets with an average and worst-case complexity of O(n²). 
It is in-place and stable but rarely used in practice due to excessive swaps.  

Selection Sort, unlike Bubble and Insertion Sort, has a consistent O(n²) time complexity in all cases. It is in-place but not stable, as it may change the relative order of equal elements. 
Despite fewer swaps, its performance is still poor for large datasets.  

Merge Sort, on the other hand, is significantly more efficient for large inputs with a consistent O(n log n) time complexity in all cases. 
However, it requires O(n) additional space, making it not in-place but stable.  

Quick Sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms, with an average and best-case time complexity of O(n log n). 
However, its worst-case complexity is O(n²) when the pivot selection is poor. Unlike Merge Sort, Quick Sort is in-place with O(log n) space complexity due to recursive function calls, but it is generally not stable.  

While Merge Sort and Quick Sort are the most efficient for large datasets, Quick Sort is usually preferred due to its in-place nature. 
Insertion Sort is useful for small or nearly sorted arrays, while Bubble Sort and Selection Sort are mostly used for educational purposes rather than practical applications.
